## Question
I want to record a 2 minute video (using my laptop camera or an iPhone, I don't have a preference) of myself talking at the camera and then embed it directly into my latte page What approach would have the fewest steps?

## Answer
The key to easily uploading videos to LATTE is the Echo360 button that is now on the activity toolbar within LATTE.

If you record with Zoom (to Zoom's cloud), the recording will automatically be copied to your Echo360 library, and you can access your recording via that button.

You can record using Zoom's Universal Capture software and it will also be in your library with easy access via the button.

If you record using your phone's built-in video recording and you have a file, you can simply click on the Echo360 button and choose "upload media" and you can upload the file directly from there.

If you are already comfortable using Zoom for recording presentations, that a good, super easy solution.

To use the echo360 button, just add an activity on LATTE (such as a label, forum, or other) OR if you want to post to "News and Announcements" which is already a forum, just add a topic. You will see the Echo360 button in the activity toolbar. It is the only colored button (blue) and it is the first button on the toolbar (top row on left).
