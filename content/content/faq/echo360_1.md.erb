## Question

I have one bit of confusion - what causes an echo360 recording to be part of a class vs. standalone? Thanks,

## Answer

In Echo360, a course is usually setup, which automatic classrooms recordings are published to. You can publish recordings that you record on your own you this course and they are then viewed via the link that we typically post on your LATTE page. 

When you add a video to your LATTE page via the button we recently added, you are just posting a video to the page, but not necessarily publishing to the Echo360 course. Student viewing analytics will only be recorded if published to the course, so keep that in mind if that is important.
