## Question

Some approaches to recording videos for classes

## Answer
I do like Echo360 although I seldom use it. I normally don’t recommend having two videos (the instructor speaking and the slides) side by side. It’s a design choice based on studies that have shown that the brain doesn’t process the information as efficiently when presented with too many visuals while trying to listen to audio, as well.  However, it may be the case that Brandeis students like to see the instructor while they speak about the slides. It would be worthwhile finding out. 

To me, the best approach is to have the instructor speaking to the camera with some text or graphics dropped in occasionally for emphasis like this: https://ensemble.brandeis.edu/Watch/w6N5Zkc4. I also like the light board for those who like to write on a whiteboard: https://ensemble.brandeis.edu/Watch/r6MXx5b9. Both of these were filmed by Chris Anderson at Media Technology Services and I directed and followed up with editing. Granted the first one, filmed with green  screen, had a good amount of editing because we had the time, but it can be adapted with dropping a PowerPoint behind as long as there is no need to cut up the lecture. The light board video however required no editing other than dropping in the title. The only thing done to the video was to flip it so that the writing appears in mirror image so you can read it.

If you find a good practice, it might be worthwhile having you demonstrate how you made it work for you. I believe Mary-Ann is looking for faculty demonstrations
